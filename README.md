## Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Projects repository by Sakkuru Kundan Srinivas!

## About
This repository contains the completed tasks for the Data Science Projects, divided into Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects. These projects aim to provide hands-on experience in data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Projects Overview

### Phase 1 Projects
1. **Dataset Creation**: Created a CSV dataset using Python, Pandas, and a public API.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the dataset by replacing missing values, removing outliers, etc.

### Phase 2 Projects
3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Analyzed the dataset and created graphs using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Trained a simple linear regression model on the dataset and made predictions.

## Repository Structure
- `Phase1/`: Contains the completed tasks for Phase 1 projects.
  - `COB_Data Science_Internship_Task1.ipynb.py`: Python script for creating the dataset.
  - `COB_Data Science_Internship_Task1.ipynb`: Python script for cleaning the dataset.
- `Phase2/`: Contains the completed tasks for Phase 2 projects.
  - `data_analysis_visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization.
  - `predictive_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training the predictive model.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired Phase folder (`Phase1` or `Phase2`).
3. Execute the Python scripts or open the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the completed tasks.

## Rules and Guidelines
- Maintain a separate branch for each phase of the project.
- Ensure all project source code is uploaded to this repository.
- Upload task completion videos to LinkedIn and tag @CodesOnBytes.
- Complete at least one task from each Phase 1 & Phase 2 projects to be eligible for a certificate.
- Complete all given tasks in Phase 1 & Phase 2 projects to be eligible for both a certificate and Letter of Recommendation.
- Plagiarism will result in termination from the internship.
- Inactiveness during your tenure may lead to termination from the internship.
